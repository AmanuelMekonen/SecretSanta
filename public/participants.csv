Megan DeVine,301170,Josh Pehrson,"I love anything gym/exercise/working out related & spending time with my doggy, so treats & toys for her are always fun!!! My favorite nighttime activity is lighting a candle (so contrary to the top of the form, I happily welcome scented candles as a gift lol), smoking a joint & coloring in a coloring book! I will always be happy to accept coloring books/colored pencils! Other than that, I am not huge on knick knacks or trinkets - I tend to keep what I own to a minimum! Therefore, if you’re struggling to think of something to get me, I would simply love a giftcard to your favorite coffee shop or restaurant so that I have something new to try! ALSO I LOVE CHICA CHIDA TEQUILA MORE THAN LIFE! SUCH AN EASY GIFT FOR ME! "
